#### Carthage
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate [VoxeetSDK](https://github.com/voxeet/voxeet-ios-sdk) into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "voxeet/voxeet-ios-sdk" ~> 1.0
```

Run `carthage update`
